# 🧠 Parkinson_Detection_Multimodal

**Parkinson_Detection_Multimodal** is a real-time machine learning system designed to detect Parkinson’s Disease using three diverse input modalities — **Spiral Drawings**, **Voice Recordings**, and **Posture Videos**.  
It integrates image classification, audio signal analysis, pose estimation, and deep learning to deliver insightful and multimodal predictions.

## 🧩 Features

- Detect Parkinson’s Disease from **Spiral Drawings**, **Voice**, and **Posture**
- Predict:
  - Possibility of Parkinson’s
  - **Stage** of the disease
  - Suggested **next steps**
- Maintain **patient history** for recovery tracking
- Multimodal Fusion Model for accurate diagnosis
- Ready for future deployment in clinical tools
